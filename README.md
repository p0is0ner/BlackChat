BlackChat is a Python Chat software I'm making...
It probably will take a long time because I'm a student and I have a lot of things to do.

So this project is divided in two different versions:

- a CLI based version running on Unix based systems
- another version based on the web, will be made using Twisted framework

The particularity of this open-source python software will be the security (SSL encryption system) and the anonimity based on relay node server (bit like Tor). 

The CLI version is a tool you can use through the terminal, launching your client script to connect after creating an account. You can send strings and files (all kinds except pictures for the moment)

For the CLI version the server is hosted on a server machine (I'm actually using raspberry pi), encrypting the traffic and data with SSL technology.

There is only one coder for the moment, it's me, p0is0n

Hope you'll enjoy this first software
