BlackChat is a Python Chat software I'm making...
It probably will take a long time because I'm a student and I have a lot of things to do.

So this project is divided in two different versions:

- a CLI based version running on Unix based systems
- another version based on the web, will be made using Twisted framework

The particularity of this open-source python software will be the security (AES 256 bit encryption system) and the anonimity based on relay nodes servers (bit like Tor). 

The CLI version is a tool you can use through the terminal, launching your client script to connect after creating an account. You can send strings and files (all kinds except pictures for the moment)

For the CLI version the server is hosted on Raspberry pi cluster machine, so it's fast and secure, everything is encrypted using AES encryption

There is only one coder for the moment, it's me, p0is0n

Hope you'll enjoy this first software
