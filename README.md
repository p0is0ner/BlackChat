# BlackChat
# made by p0is0n [aka]

BlackChat is a Python Chat software I'm making...
It probably will take a long time because I'm a student and I have a lot of things to do.

So this project is divided in two different versions:

- a CLI based version running on Unix based systems
- another version based on the web, will be made using Twisted framework

The particularity of this open-source python software will be the security (encryption PGP) and the anonimity based on relay nodes servers (bit like Tor)

There is only one coder for the moment, it's me, p0is0n

Hope you'll enjoy
